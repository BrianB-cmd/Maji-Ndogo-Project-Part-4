#Overview
The Maji Ndogo Water Project helps bring clean water to a community in need. This Part 4 focuses on tracking money spent to keep everything open and honest. We use a simple Power BI dashboard to show:
-48% of people now have basic water access.
-4 million people helped so far.
-22% of the project is done, with 19,910 water sources still needing work.
-Spent $33.8 million (a bit over the $30.5 million goal).
-Crime near water points is down thanks to better access.
-This project uses easy tools like Power BI and SQL to show how money is used.

#Questions Answered

#Processes
1)Data Collection
-We gathered survey data from regions on water access and population and collected budget and spending data from project managers and vendors along with record completion dates and intervention types such as drilling wells and installing taps.

2)Data Cleaning
-Used Power query to fix missing values and errors in CSV files and check for duplicates or wrong numbers.

3)Data Analysis
-Calculated percentages and totals in Power BI.
Step 3: Identify trends, like crime reduction, using simple charts.

4)Dashboard Creation
Added visuals such as map for regions, pie chart for costs, bar chart for interventions and set up filters.
